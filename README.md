# NFT Aggregator
NFT's in Solana


**NFT aggregator** -  is a program that provides any information to solana nft by entering the address of the token. The information is sent to the database using an API request from moralis.io and then the information is displayed on the site. The program itself runs in Python. Connecting to a Postgres database (Pg admin4). I also use html, css, bootstrap for the site.

**Moralis.io** - provides world-class APIs to developers across the globe, allowing companies and projects of all sizes to seamlessly integrate blockchain into their solutions stack and scale with ease. [Moralis.io](https://moralis.io/) is here.

**About my python-flask code:** The Python code was built from various open tutorials from YouTube and websites, and was also taken from assignment 3.

**About my postgres connect code:** Basic postgres connection with flask helped: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-a-postgresql-database-in-a-flask-application

**About my html code:** With help w3schools.com


## Installation

**Python:**
Install the current version of Python: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/ru-ru/pycharm/)


Version: 2022.2.3
Assembly: 222.4345.23
October 11, 2022


**Postgres:** [Pg Admin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)


Version 6.1 (4280.88)


***Terminal in PyCharm:*** 
```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```
```bash
pip install flask
```
```bash
pip install requests
```
```bash
pip install flask-request
```

***In PgAdmin4***: 

Open the PostgreSQL 14 and ***CREATE NEW DATABASE and CALL IT "pythondb""***.
Open the ***pythondb database*** >>> ***Schemas*** >>> ***Tables*** >> right mouse button and click ***Query Tool*** >>> ***Query Editor*** >>> ***Paste it***:

```
CREATE TABLE nft (address VARCHAR(950), info VARCHAR(950))
```

```
CREATE TABLE userdb (
	username VARCHAR ( 50 ) NOT NULL,
	password VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL
);
```

## Usage

1)
***Solana art:***
You can get the address of the token for the nft aggregator by going to the site and choosing any nft token.
[Solana.art](https://solanart.io/)

***

To get contract level metadata (minta, standard, name, symbol, metaplex) for a given network and contract, use this snippet responsible for this:
```python
import requests

url = "https://solana-gateway.moralis.io/nft/network/address/metadata"

headers = {"accept": "application/json"}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```
2)

The dict cursors allow to access to the attributes of retrieved records using an interface similar to the Python dictionaries instead of the tuples.

Reference: https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extras.html
```
>>> dict_cur = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor)
>>> dict_cur.execute("INSERT INTO test (num, data) VALUES(%s, %s)",
...                  (100, "abc'def"))
```

3)
This object is added to the password before hashing to ensure that the hash cannot be used in a rainbow table attack.

Since the object is generated randomly each time you call the function, the resulting password hash is also different. The returned hash includes the generated object so that the password can be validated correctly.

Demo:
```
>>> from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash
>>> generate_password_hash('foobar')
'pbkdf2:sha1:1000$tYqN0VeL$2ee2568465fa30c1e6680196f8bb9eb0d2ca072d'
>>> generate_password_hash('foobar')
'pbkdf2:sha1:1000$XHj5nlLU$bb9a81bc54e7d6e11d9ab212cd143e768ea6225d'
```

***My codes with different conditions:***



The first code was made with flask python and a snippet from moralis.io. It works without a database:
```python
from flask import Flask
import requests
from flask import render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def form_example():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        nftaddress = request.form.get('nftaddress')

        url = f'https://solana-gateway.moralis.io/nft/mainnet/' + nftaddress + '/metadata'
        headers = {"accept": "application/json",
                   "X-API-Key": "u8emWI08OHGRqpKRzmO3Y3gW4OhbTdOdVRuJobooGeSvYRGjep6bmjuIDVu8RqEI"}

        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

        return f''' 
         <h1>infp: {response.text} </h1>
                         '''
    return '''
              <form method="POST">
                  <div><label>Get address: <input type="text" name="nftaddress"></label></div>
                  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
              </form>'''


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```


The second code was made with a database but without a snippet from moralis.io:

```python
import psycopg2
from flask import Flask
from flask import render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def form_example():
    if request.method == 'POST':


       connection = psycopg2.connect(user="postgres",
                              password="3008",
                              host="127.0.0.1",
                              port="5432",
                              database="homedb")
       cursor = connection.cursor()
       address = request.form.get('nftaddress')
       postgreSQL_select_Query = "SELECT info FROM nft WHERE address=" + "'" + address + "'" + ";"
       cursor.execute(postgreSQL_select_Query)
       mobile_records = cursor.fetchall()

    for row in mobile_records:

       return f''' 
              <h1>infp: {row[0]} </h1>
       
                             '''

       cursor.close()
       connection.close()


    return '''
                      <form method="POST">
                          <div><label>Get address: <input type="text" name="nftaddress"></label></div>
                          <input type="submit" value="Submit">
                      </form>'''

if __name__ == '__main__':
 app.run(debug=True)
```

***Examples for use:***

Run main.py.

Click localhost in terminal, and and the program will open your browser.

Firstly, you must be registered in order to work with nft

Secondly, after successful registration, you need to enter your data in the login to enter

You need paste it token(from solana art) in "nft address" and click "Get info".

After clicking on the site, information about your nft that you entered earlier will be displayed.

Finally, you can sign out after using
